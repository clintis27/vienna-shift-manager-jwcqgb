You're looking to build a comprehensive mobile app for the \"Hotel House of Vienna Shift Manager\" with features covering shift scheduling, time tracking, and HR reporting. You've outlined a detailed plan, and you want to proceed step-by-step, starting with the environment setup and requirements documentation.\n\nHere's a plan to get started with the React Native + Expo 54 app, focusing on the initial setup and core features:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Login/Registration:** Implement basic login and registration screens.\n*   **Employee Calendar:** Display a simple employee calendar view with shift details.\n*   **Time Tracking:** Integrate a GPS-based clock-in/out feature.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light Gray)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#1976D2` (Deep Blue - Vienna hotel color)\n    *   Secondary: `#FFC107` (Gold - Vienna hotel color)\n    *   Accent: `#448AFF` (Light Blue)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#BBDEFB` (Very Light Blue)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like Montserrat or Open Sans.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** No code changes needed. This step involves setting up the development environment, Git repository, project board, coding standards, and CI/CD pipeline.\n2.  **Requirements Documentation:** No code changes needed. This step involves gathering app needs, writing documentation, mapping user journeys, and listing non-functional requirements.\n3.  **Architecture and Database:** No code changes needed. This step involves deciding on the architecture, choosing the stack, sketching data models, and outlining key API endpoints and security.\n4.  **Implement Basic UI Components:**\n    *   Read `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to understand the existing structure of the home screen.\n    *   Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to remove the modalDemos array. This array is not needed for the core features of the app.\n\nAfter the coding agent has implemented the plan, please remove the modalDemos array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-23T16:55:19.788672"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build the Hotel House of Vienna Shift Manager app step-by-step.

You need the app modified to support three categories of employees (Breakfast, Housekeeping, and Front Desk), each with its own admin. Additionally, you want to add a calendar feature where employees can book the days they want to work. Here's a breakdown of the features and how we can approach them:\n\n1.  **Employee Categories and Separate Admins:**\n    *   **Data Model:** We'll need to modify the user data model to include a \"category\" field (Breakfast, Housekeeping, Front Desk).\n    *   **Admin Roles:** Implement role-based access control, where each category has a designated admin user. The admin user will be assigned to a specific category.\n    *   **Access Control:** Modify the admin features to filter data based on the admin's assigned category. For example, a Breakfast admin can only manage Breakfast employees and schedules.\n\n2.  **Employee Calendar for Booking Shifts:**\n    *   **Calendar View:** Integrate a calendar component (e.g., using a library like `react-native-calendars`) into the app.\n    *   **Shift Booking:** Allow employees to select dates on the calendar to request shifts.\n    *   **Availability:** Implement a mechanism for employees to mark their availability for specific days.\n    *   **Admin Approval:** The category admin should be able to view and approve/reject employee shift requests.\n    *   **Conflict Detection:** Implement logic to prevent double-booking or scheduling conflicts.\n\nTo proceed, I'll need to examine the existing code to determine the best way to implement these changes.

Now let me create a summary document to explain what has been implemented:\n\n## Summary\n\nI've successfully implemented the requested features for your Hotel House of Vienna Shift Manager app. Here's what has been added:\n\n### \u2705 **Three Employee Categories**\n- **Breakfast** - Orange color (#F57C00)\n- **Housekeeping** - Green color (#388E3C)\n- **Front Desk** - Blue color (#1976D2)\n\n### \u2705 **Separate Admins for Each Category**\nEach category now has its own admin who can:\n- View only shift requests from their category\n- Approve or reject shift requests\n- See statistics for pending, approved, and rejected requests\n- Automatically create scheduled shifts when approving requests\n\n**Demo Admin Accounts:**\n- Breakfast Admin: `breakfast-admin@vienna.com` (password: any 6+ chars)\n- Housekeeping Admin: `housekeeping-admin@vienna.com` (password: any 6+ chars)\n- Front Desk Admin: `frontdesk-admin@vienna.com` (password: any 6+ chars)\n\n### \u2705 **Employee Calendar for Booking Shifts**\nEmployees can now:\n- View a monthly calendar\n- Select multiple days they want to work\n- Mark days as available\n- Request shifts for specific dates\n- See the status of their requests (Pending/Approved/Rejected)\n- View color-coded indicators on the calendar\n\n### \ud83d\udcf1 **New Screens Added**\n\n1. **Availability Screen** (`app/(tabs)/availability.tsx`)\n   - Interactive calendar for selecting work days\n   - Legend showing different status colors\n   - Two action buttons: \"Mark as Available\" and \"Request Shifts\"\n   - List of all shift requests with status badges\n\n2. **Admin Panel** (`app/(tabs)/admin.tsx`)\n   - Only visible to admin users\n   - Statistics dashboard showing pending/approved/rejected counts\n   - Filter tabs to view requests by status\n   - Approve/Reject buttons for pending requests\n   - Category-specific filtering (admins only see their category)\n\n3. **Updated Registration** (`app/(auth)/register.tsx`)\n   - Category selection with visual buttons\n   - Icons for each category (cup for breakfast, bed for housekeeping, people for front desk)\n\n### \ud83d\udd04 **Updated Features**\n\n- **Profile Screen**: Now displays user category badge\n- **Home Screen**: Shows category-specific information and quick access to new features\n- **Tab Navigation**: Dynamically shows Admin tab only for admin users\n- **Data Types**: Extended to support categories, shift requests, and availability tracking\n\n### \ud83c\udfa8 **User Experience**\n\n- Clean, modern UI with category-specific colors\n- Smooth animations and transitions\n- Dark mode support throughout\n- Intuitive calendar interface\n- Clear status indicators (pending = yellow, approved = green, rejected = red)\n\n### \ud83d\udcca **How It Works**\n\n1. **Employees** select their category during registration\n2. **Employees** use the Availability screen to book days they want to work\n3. **Shift requests** are created and stored locally\n4. **Category admins** review requests in their Admin panel\n5. **Approved requests** automatically become scheduled shifts\n6. **Employees** can see their approved shifts in the Schedule and Home screens\n\nAll data is stored locally using AsyncStorage, so the app works offline. The system is fully functional and ready to use!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-10-23T17:27:06Z"}]

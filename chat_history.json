You're looking to build a comprehensive mobile app for the \"Hotel House of Vienna Shift Manager\" with features covering shift scheduling, time tracking, and HR reporting. You've outlined a detailed plan, and you want to proceed step-by-step, starting with the environment setup and requirements documentation.\n\nHere's a plan to get started with the React Native + Expo 54 app, focusing on the initial setup and core features:\n\n**Features for the First Version:**\n\n*   **Login/Registration:** Implement basic login and registration screens.\n*   **Employee Calendar:** Display a simple employee calendar view with shift details.\n*   **Time Tracking:** Integrate a GPS-based clock-in/out feature.\n\n**Design Elements:**\n\n*   **Colors:**\n    *   Background: `#F5F5F5` (Light Gray)\n    *   Text: `#212121` (Dark Gray)\n    *   TextSecondary: `#757575` (Medium Gray)\n    *   Primary: `#1976D2` (Deep Blue - Vienna hotel color)\n    *   Secondary: `#FFC107` (Gold - Vienna hotel color)\n    *   Accent: `#448AFF` (Light Blue)\n    *   Card: `#FFFFFF` (White)\n    *   Highlight: `#BBDEFB` (Very Light Blue)\n*   **Typography:** Use modern, clean fonts like Montserrat or Open Sans.\n\n**Plan:**\n\n1.  **Project Setup:** No code changes needed. This step involves setting up the development environment, Git repository, project board, coding standards, and CI/CD pipeline.\n2.  **Requirements Documentation:** No code changes needed. This step involves gathering app needs, writing documentation, mapping user journeys, and listing non-functional requirements.\n3.  **Architecture and Database:** No code changes needed. This step involves deciding on the architecture, choosing the stack, sketching data models, and outlining key API endpoints and security.\n4.  **Implement Basic UI Components:**\n    *   Read `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to understand the existing structure of the home screen.\n    *   Modify `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx` to remove the modalDemos array. This array is not needed for the core features of the app.\n\nAfter the coding agent has implemented the plan, please remove the modalDemos array from `app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx`.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-23T16:55:19.788672"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you build the Hotel House of Vienna Shift Manager app step-by-step.

You need the app modified to support three categories of employees (Breakfast, Housekeeping, and Front Desk), each with its own admin. Additionally, you want to add a calendar feature where employees can book the days they want to work. Here's a breakdown of the features and how we can approach them:\n\n1.  **Employee Categories and Separate Admins:**\n    *   **Data Model:** We'll need to modify the user data model to include a \"category\" field (Breakfast, Housekeeping, Front Desk).\n    *   **Admin Roles:** Implement role-based access control, where each category has a designated admin user. The admin user will be assigned to a specific category.\n    *   **Access Control:** Modify the admin features to filter data based on the admin's assigned category. For example, a Breakfast admin can only manage Breakfast employees and schedules.\n\n2.  **Employee Calendar for Booking Shifts:**\n    *   **Calendar View:** Integrate a calendar component (e.g., using a library like `react-native-calendars`) into the app.\n    *   **Shift Booking:** Allow employees to select dates on the calendar to request shifts.\n    *   **Availability:** Implement a mechanism for employees to mark their availability for specific days.\n    *   **Admin Approval:** The category admin should be able to view and approve/reject employee shift requests.\n    *   **Conflict Detection:** Implement logic to prevent double-booking or scheduling conflicts.\n\nTo proceed, I'll need to examine the existing code to determine the best way to implement these changes.

Modify it to match the style in the image. Use a `BlurView` for the background, and ensure the icons and labels are clear and appropriately sized.\n*   **Color Palette:** Define a color palette in your `styles/commonStyles.ts` file that includes the pastel colors and gradients you want to use.\n*   **Cards:** Create a reusable `Card` component with rounded corners, a white background, and a subtle shadow. Use this component to display information and actions on your screens.\n*   **Gradients:** Use the `expo-linear-gradient` package to create the gradient backgrounds for your buttons and other interactive elements.\n*   **Typography:** Ensure you are using the Montserrat or Open Sans fonts as specified earlier, and that the text sizes and weights are consistent throughout the app.\n\nTo implement these changes, you'll need to modify your existing components and styles. Start by updating the `FloatingTabBar` to match the design in the image. Then, create the `Card` component and use it in your `HomeScreen` and other relevant screens. Finally, adjust the color palette and typography to match the overall style.\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-23T17:35:59.314893"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you implement the modern, minimalist style shown in those images!

This will require setting up push notification credentials for both iOS and Android. A notification panel can be added as a new screen or component within the app, displaying a list of recent notifications fetched from a data source. User preferences can be managed in the profile screen and stored using `AsyncStorage`.\n*   **Monthly Employee Reports:** Generating PDF reports will likely require a server-side component. Since you're not using Supabase, consider using a Node.js server (deployed on a platform like Heroku or AWS Lambda) to generate the reports using a library like PDFKit. The app can then fetch these reports via an API endpoint. The admin panel will need UI elements for filtering reports by employee, department, or date range, and for initiating bulk downloads.\n\nLet me know if you'd like a more detailed breakdown of any of these steps!\n"}, {"type": "role_transition", "from_role": "planner", "to_role": "coder", "timestamp": "2025-10-23T18:30:17.983904"}, {"type": "text", "text": "I'll help you implement Real-Time Notifications and Monthly Employee Report & Download features for your Hotel House of Vienna shift management app. Let me first search for relevant implementation patterns.Let me read the current project structure to understand the existing implementation:"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "types/index.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "utils/storage.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "utils/mockData.ts", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "file_read", "file_name": "app/(tabs)/profile.tsx", "status": "complete"}, {"type": "text", "text": "Now let me install the necessary dependencies for push notifications and implement the features:"}, {"type": "dependency_management", "action": "install", "dependencies": ["expo-notifications", "expo-device"], "status": "complete", "success": true, "stdout": "Progress: resolved 1, reused 0, downloaded 0, added 0\n\u2009WARN\u2009 deprecated @babel/plugin-proposal-export-namespace-from@7.18.9: This proposal has been merged to the ECMAScript standard and thus this plugin is no longer maintained.

Click \"Add Shift\" button\n2. Select an employee from your category\n3. Pick a date from the calendar\n4. Set start and end times\n5. Add optional notes\n6. Click \"Add Shift\" to create\n\n**For Removing Shifts:**\n1. Click \"Manage Shifts\" button\n2. View all scheduled shifts for your category\n3. Click the trash icon on any shift\n4. Confirm deletion\n5. Employee receives a notification about the cancellation\n\nThe system maintains category-based access control, so each admin (Breakfast, Housekeeping, Front Desk) only sees and manages shifts for their own department. All actions trigger real-time notifications to keep employees informed!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}], "timestamp": "2025-10-24T17:02:03Z"}]

## ⚠️ MINOR OPTIMIZATIONS (Non-Blocking)

### 1. Database Performance
**Status:** Working, but can be optimized later

The app has multiple permissive RLS policies which work correctly but could be optimized:
- Employees table: 2 SELECT policies, 2 UPDATE policies
- Shifts table: 2 SELECT policies  
- Sick leave certificates: 2 SELECT policies

**Impact:** Minor performance overhead
**Action:** Can be optimized after launch by combining policies with OR conditions
**Priority:** Low - optimize when you have significant user load

### 2. Unused Indexes
**Status:** Normal for new app

Several database indexes haven't been used yet:
- `idx_employees_user_id`, `idx_employees_role`, `idx_employees_category`
- `idx_shifts_employee_id`, `idx_shifts_date`, `idx_shifts_status`

**Impact:** None - these are properly configured
**Action:** Keep them - they'll be used as data grows
**Priority:** No action needed

### 3. Push Notifications
**Status:** Fixed ✅

Updated the push notification configuration to handle missing project IDs gracefully.

**Action:** When you deploy to production, update the project ID in your environment variables or app.json

## 🔐 SECURITY NOTES

### Current Security Status: EXCELLENT ✅

1. **Authentication:** Supabase Auth with JWT tokens
2. **Data Access:** Row Level Security on all tables
3. **API Keys:** Using anon key (safe for client-side)
4. **Biometric:** Face ID/Touch ID for quick login
5. **Offline:** Data encrypted in AsyncStorage

### Security Best Practices Implemented:
- ✅ No sensitive data in code
- ✅ RLS policies prevent unauthorized access
- ✅ Session tokens auto-refresh
- ✅ Proper logout clears all local data
- ✅ Admin actions require admin role verification

---

## 📊 CURRENT DATABASE STATUS

**Tables Created:** 3
- `employees` (0 rows) - RLS enabled ✅
- `shifts` (0 rows) - RLS enabled ✅
- `sick_leave_certificates` (0 rows) - RLS enabled ✅

**Migrations Applied:** 2
1. `create_employees_and_sick_leave_tables`
2. `optimize_rls_policies_and_add_indexes`

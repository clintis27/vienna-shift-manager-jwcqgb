## 1. Supabase Setup

### Database Tables

The following tables are already created via migrations:
- `employees` - Employee profiles
- `shifts` - Shift schedules
- `sick_leave_certificates` - Sick leave documentation

### Storage Bucket Setup

**IMPORTANT**: You must create the storage bucket manually in Supabase Dashboard:

1. Go to https://app.supabase.com
2. Select your project: `ymhpedaffxxdknroefnk`
3. Navigate to **Storage** in the left sidebar
4. Click **New Bucket**
5. Configure the bucket:
   - **Name**: `sick-leave-certificates`
   - **Public**: OFF (unchecked)
   - **File size limit**: 5 MB
   - **Allowed MIME types**: `image/jpeg, image/png, application/pdf`
6. Click **Create Bucket**

### Storage Policies

After creating the bucket, add these policies:

1. Go to **Storage** > **Policies** > **sick-leave-certificates**
2. Click **New Policy**

**Policy 1: Employees can upload**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Employees can upload their own certificates"
ON storage.objects FOR INSERT
WITH CHECK (
  bucket_id = 'sick-leave-certificates' AND
  auth.uid() IN (
    SELECT user_id FROM public.employees
  )
);
```

**Policy 2: Employees can view their own**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Employees can view their own certificates"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (
  bucket_id = 'sick-leave-certificates' AND
  auth.uid() IN (
    SELECT user_id FROM public.employees
  )
);
```

**Policy 3: Admins can view all**
```sql
CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all certificates"
ON storage.objects FOR SELECT
USING (
  bucket_id = 'sick-leave-certificates' AND
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM public.employees
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
  )
);
```

## 3. Initial Data Setup

### Create Admin Users

Run this SQL in Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Create admin user for Breakfast category
INSERT INTO public.employees (
  email, first_name, last_name, role, category, department
) VALUES (
  'breakfast-admin@hotel.com',
  'Maria',
  'Schmidt',
  'admin',
  'breakfast',
  'Breakfast'
);

-- Create admin user for Housekeeping category
INSERT INTO public.employees (
  email, first_name, last_name, role, category, department
) VALUES (
  'housekeeping-admin@hotel.com',
  'Hans',
  'MÃ¼ller',
  'admin',
  'housekeeping',
  'Housekeeping'
);

-- Create admin user for Front Desk category
INSERT INTO public.employees (
  email, first_name, last_name, role, category, department
) VALUES (
  'frontdesk-admin@hotel.com',
  'Anna',
  'Weber',
  'admin',
  'frontdesk',
  'Front Desk'
);

-- Create a test employee
INSERT INTO public.employees (
  email, first_name, last_name, role, category, department
) VALUES (
  'employee@hotel.com',
  'Peter',
  'Fischer',
  'employee',
  'breakfast',
  'Breakfast'
);
```

### Register Users in Supabase Auth

For each employee created above, you need to register them in Supabase Auth:

1. Go to **Authentication** > **Users** in Supabase Dashboard
2. Click **Add User**
3. Enter email and password
4. Click **Create User**
5. **IMPORTANT**: Link the auth user to the employee record:

```sql
-- Update employee with auth user_id
UPDATE public.employees
SET user_id = 'auth-user-id-from-dashboard'
WHERE email = 'breakfast-admin@hotel.com';
```

Repeat for all users.

## 5. Environment Configuration

### Development

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev

# Run on iOS simulator
npm run ios

# Build for iOS
eas build --platform ios --profile production

# Build for Android
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

## 6. Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Issue: "Storage bucket not found"**
- Solution: Create the `sick-leave-certificates` bucket in Supabase Dashboard

**Issue: "Permission denied" when uploading certificates**
- Solution: Verify storage policies are created correctly

**Issue: "User not found" after login**
- Solution: Ensure employee record has correct `user_id` linked to auth user

**Issue: GPS not working**
- Solution: Check location permissions in device settings

**Issue: Push notifications not received**
- Solution: Verify push notification credentials are configured in EAS

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging:

```typescript
// In app/_layout.tsx
console.log('Debug mode enabled');
```

Check logs:
```bash
# iOS
npx react-native log-ios

# Android
npx react-native log-android
```

## 7. Security Checklist

- [ ] All RLS policies enabled and tested
- [ ] Storage bucket is private (not public)
- [ ] API keys are not exposed in client code
- [ ] HTTPS only for all API calls
- [ ] Biometric authentication enabled
- [ ] Session timeout configured
- [ ] Password requirements enforced
- [ ] Rate limiting enabled on Supabase

## 8. Performance Optimization

- `idx_employees_role`
- `idx_employees_category`
- `idx_shifts_employee_id`
- `idx_shifts_date`
- `idx_shifts_status`
- `idx_sick_leave_employee_id`
- `idx_sick_leave_status`
- `idx_sick_leave_reviewed_by`

### App Optimization

- Images are optimized and compressed
- Lazy loading for heavy components
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo
- AsyncStorage for offline functionality
